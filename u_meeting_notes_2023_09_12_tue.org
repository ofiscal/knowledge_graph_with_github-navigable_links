#+title: meeting notes <2023-09-12 Tue>: legal structure of the budget
* 3 kinds of budget items
  deuda servicio, gasto functionamiento, gasto inversion
* dimensions
** func v. inversion is a legal, not economic, distinction
** sector is another dimension
** entity is another
* un sector es un conjunto de entidades
  and no entity is in more than one sector
* f differs fro i only in where the money goes
* i is disagg'd into program/project
* f is disagg'd into "cuentas"
  personal {salarios, ...}, transferencias,
  adq de bienes y servicios,
  pago de multas
* four stages of spending
  apropriacion
  compromiso
  oblig = ejecutado
  pago

  With a few exceptions, "compromisos" are for a year or less -- they are not long term.
