** Smaller firms are owned by poorer entrepreneurs
   (La Porta and Shleifer 2014,
   Ulyssea 2018,
   Brown and Medoff 1989)
** Taxes passed through employees’ wages
   (Fuest et al. 2018,
   Arulampalam et al. 2012,
   Suárez Serrato and Zidar 2016)

   Inverted U-shaped relationship:

    2. ETR decreases at the top for the largest firms in most
