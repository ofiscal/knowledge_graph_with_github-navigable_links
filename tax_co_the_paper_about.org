* TODO add a "limitations" section
** a list
*** we assume sales are immediate
    that is, taxed as "income, non-labor (tax def)"
    rather than "ganancias ocasionales".
*** desactualizado
*** not representative in the upper tail of income
*** divide by zero, consumption not matching income
*** restaurants and hotels are grouped together but have different VAT rates
** make clear which are our fault and which are data limitations
* TODO mention how flexibly we can model VAT changes
  makes it hard to export but more useful for Colombia
* TODO Say why each VAT in the 12 main categories is what it is.
* TODO Talk about the COICOP table.
* TODO Tell the economists they have to read the source code
  because comments are invisible.
* TODO Assign tasks to co-authors.
* TODO Write this into the microsim paper.
  esp. p. 14

** Just say what happens to the top and bottom deciles.
* TODO write up flat VAT sim results
** what the sims Daniel ran are
*** one is the default -- no changes
*** one is the VAT all at 19%
* BLOCKED (whatsapped) : ask Oliver for institutional details of flat tax sim

* TODO edits
** We are estimating theoretical tax burden, not actual.
   if all the laws were enforced and obeyed
