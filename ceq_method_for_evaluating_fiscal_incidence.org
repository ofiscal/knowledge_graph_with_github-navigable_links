#+title: CEQ (method for evaluating fiscal incidence)
* TODO see screenshots
* notes from a presentation by Nora Lustig, <2022-10-21 Fri>
** at the Commitment to Equity Institute
** goal(s)
*** comparability (across-country, I think)
*** measuring equity (redistribution and poverty reduction) effects of fiscal (both sides) policy)
** terms
*** Y = income after taxes
*** I = income before
*** T = taxes (paid by household)
*** B = benefits (received by household)
*** S = share
** need federal audit
** somehow takes indirect effects of indirect taxes into account
** is a stata package
** generates "income concepts"
*** TODO screenshot 1
*** may need to impute, use secondary sources, etc. for missing information, or to check it
** the "accounting approach", and some limitations to it
*** TODO screenshot 2
** assumptions (screenshot 3)
*** tax evasion assumptions (screenshot 4)
*** assumptions can be played around with if you know about the country
** monetizing in-kind transfers is hard (screenshot 5)
** pensions (screenshot 6)
*** hard -- do you think about time?
    If not, it's a pure transfer; if so, it's forced savings.
    Implied effects on inequality are different.
*** screenshot 7
** There's a CEQ Data Center
** interesting: indirect taxes and spending can be equalizing, as can tertiary education spending
** weird: fiscal policy can be equalizing and simultaneously poverty-increasing
*** example: a progressive tax that vanishes, benefitting nobody
*** better: make the poor net beneficiaries
