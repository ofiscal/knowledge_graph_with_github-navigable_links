*** Is there a good default value?
**** the question
 Below, for the 1/100 sample, I've gone through each file origin and indicated the number of "weight" observations (because that's never missing) and the number of "freq" observations. Notice that for some kinds of files, freq is very missing. If there was a reasonable defautl frequency to use for those files, we could avoid throwing out a lot of observations (in total, 1 in 14 is missing a frequency value).

 I thought maybe the default for "menos frecuentes - articulos" would be yearly, and for the "semanal" files, weekly, and the "diaro" files, daily -- but that's based on very little information ...

**** the data supporting it

**** how I generated that data
 df = data.purchases[ ["weight","freq","file-origin"] ]
 for fo in df["file-origin"].unique():
   print( "\n" + fo )
   print( df[ df["file-origin"]==fo] .count() )
* meh
** outliers
*** household-member: rural_semanal and urban_diario both reach at least to 82
