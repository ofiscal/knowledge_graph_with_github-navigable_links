* TODO "income, labor" != "income, labor + cesantias"
* TODO the fuzz is breaking the nonzero-ness of labor income earners
* TODO columns to generate
** salary in minimos (millions COP per month), from 3 to 25
** current tax bill based solely on labor income
** BLOCKED future  tax bill based solely on labor income, under scenario:
*** BLOCKED on Oliver
** the difference between those two bills
** the quantile of that salary
* TODO Bugfix: email attachments depend on user strategy, but strategy is being loaded from the default config file.
** verify that the process completes, and emails to me
** undo subsample change on AWS
** commit changes in tax.co on AWS
* DONE make new groups
** one option: 9 deciles, next 9 percentiles, top 10 milliles
*** 0-10, 10-20, .. 80-90
*** 90, 91..99
*** 99.0,99.1..99.9
** another: 9 deciles, one near-decile, one near-percentile, and the top millile
*** 0-10, 10-20, .. 80-90
*** 90-99	(as one group)
*** 99.0 - 99.9 (as one group)
*** top millile
* DONE add rows
  all kinds of income
  all kinds of taxes
* DONE new groups: top ten miltiles
  in people_4 and households_1, search for "income-perc"
** DONE generate the income-millile column
** DONE use the top ten income milliles in the report
* DONE new stats
  income, average & total
  income taxes paid, average & total
  average tax rate, i.e. average of ( taxes paid / income )
  aggregate taxes / aggregate income
* graph change in after-tax income
* BLOCKED one where there's only one marginal income tax schedule
  So what's the specific formula? Don't exempt any of the other stuff?
* BLOCKED other inputs pending
** one where marginal tax rates on "most" change
** one where ganacias ocasionales changes
** BLOCKED one where deductions are absolute rather than proportional
   What's the deduction limit?
** one with every change
* Ponder: Which tax does an increase in revenue/taxes paid come from?
* DONE ? Can we look within the top 1%
  See program
    python/exemplar/zoom_top_quantile.py
  which outputs to
    zoom-in-on-rich/
* actividad economica X formal/informal
