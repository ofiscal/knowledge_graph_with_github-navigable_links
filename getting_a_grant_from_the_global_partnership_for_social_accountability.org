https://thegpsa.org/
* BLOCKED What does this quote mean? How to do it?
** the quote
   "Review your country’s priority theme(s) included in the country call for proposals."
** my confusion
   I've found their (general) 5th Call for Proposals,
   but no (country-specific) "country call for proposals".
** I've emailed their help desk about it.
