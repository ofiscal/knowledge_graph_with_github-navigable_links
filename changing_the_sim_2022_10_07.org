#+title: changing the sim 2022-10-07
per the latest tax reform discussion in Congress
* ref
  Renta-y-Complementarios-PN.by-William.docx
* DONE add a new CGG strategy
** add another column, compute a "dependents to claim (up to 4)"
** 1210 uvt -> l1340 uvt
** deduct up to 72 uvt per dependent claimed
   from the CGG
* what Daniel will simulate
** 1210 uvt -> 1340 uvt
** dividends
*** proposal, we think
    there's the CGG: labor, nonlabor, pensions, capital
    add to that: dividends
    but there's a "descuento" of 19% of those dividends
      which is a reduction in the taxes you pay,
      rather than a reduction in the income you pay taxes on
*** an approximation
    Change the dividend tax from 10% to 20%
*** the assumption it depends on
    Dividends are a negligible fraction even of
    the income of the moderately rich.
*** what we'll do
    is raise from 10 to 20%, leave the 300 UVT threshold in place
** up to 72 uvt per dependent, up to 4 dependents per tax filer
** the ganancia ocasionales rates change
** two microsimulations
*** one just for the personal income tax
