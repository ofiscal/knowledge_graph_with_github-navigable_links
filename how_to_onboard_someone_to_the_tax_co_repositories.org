#+title: how to onboard someone to the tax.co* repositories
Where all our code is:
  https://github.com/orgs/ofiscal/repositories

The microsimulation is one of the repositories listed there:
  https://github.com/ofiscal/tax.co
In addition to the top-level README
(which you'll see when you visit that page)
this is the best place to start:
  https://github.com/ofiscal/tax.co/blob/master/markdown/running-it.md

There's a lot of documentation here:
  https://github.com/ofiscal/tax.co/tree/master/markdown
as well as README files in many other folders,
which you should look at if you want to know what that folder does.

There's a separate repository for the website:
  https://github.com/ofiscal/tax.co.web
You'll need both repositories even if you're not using the website.

Here's where to find the website when running on your own computer:
  http://localhost:8000/microsim/run_make/manual_ingest
And here's where to find it when it's running on AWS:
  http://ofiscal-puj.org/microsim/run_make/manual_ingest
