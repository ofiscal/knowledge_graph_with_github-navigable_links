#+title: extending tax.co with quantile data from DIAN
* TODO the regression uses *(natural) log of yearly* income
  so to apply them to the microsimulation,
  first divide by 12, then take the log,
  then apply the coefficients,
  then exponentiate (base e).
* notes
** imagine ganancias ocasionales taxed at 10%
   since can't tell in DIAN data
** maybe generate synthetic households
   based on the ENPH data, from the DIAN data
** need income individuals for income taxes
** use a regression to predict DIAN quantile given an ENPH observation
   income, no laboral
   income, labor
   income, capital
   income, ganancias ocasionales (total)
   income, pension
   income, dividend
* questions
** DONE How do unequal income earners split wealth on their tax declarations?
   like I thought -- hard.
   Can change the divison each year, arbitrarily.
** what's the PILA?
   SS contrib data
