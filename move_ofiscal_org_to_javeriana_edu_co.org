#+title: move ofiscal.org to javeriana.edu.co
* refs
** I asked Reddit
   https://www.reddit.com/r/WIX/comments/pp0cfg/can_i_add_some_wix_pages_to_a_nonwix_site/
* motivation
  Someone in HR wants to inflate the number of visits registered to javeriana.edu.co.
* strategies
  alternatives
** generate our own traffic to Javeriana
*** the idea
    Create a page, javeriana.edu.co/ofiscal,
    and ping it every time someone visits
    any page of ofiscal.org.
*** Daniel knows how
** move the website to javeriana.edu.co
   Expensive, hard, slow.
** redirect from ofiscal to javeriana to ofiscal
   Would introduce a delay.
