There's an enig.org file, an enph.org file, and this one which pertains to both.
* PITFALL: These notes are stale, from 2018-ish
But they might include some insights into the data due to David Suarez not recorded elsewhere.

These tables contain food expenditures that were imputed for households that did not complete the booklets used to compile tables Ig_gsdu_gas_dia and Ig_gssr_gas_sem but reported to have made purchases in the reference period of the survey.  We can only recover prices for the former, using the questions ARTICULO (COICOP code), VALOR_MENSUAL_ALIMENTO, and CANTIDAD; for the latter only total monetary values are reported.

The location variables are a little bit more difficult to get, since they are not directly available in the tables: the sample of households used in these surveys is a subsample taken from a more general survey (the GEIH) that contains the key variables to present our results by region (as well as other variables that we could use). You can find the GEIH for 2007,2016 and 2017  in the following links (they are presented by month, so we have to append the files to get the complete survey):
