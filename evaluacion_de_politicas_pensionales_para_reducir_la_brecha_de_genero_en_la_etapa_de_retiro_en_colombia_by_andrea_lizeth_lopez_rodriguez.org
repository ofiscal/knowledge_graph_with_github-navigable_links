   as functions of age and education.
   See "anexo 1", p. 54.
** For single people, uses simple life expectancy. For couples, joint life expectancy.
* fancy data she uses
  "Con respecto a los salarios, se cuenta con información desagregada por género proveniente de las bases de datos de las historias laborales de Colpensiones"
* TODO ? potential improvements
** Rather than assuming static salaries,
   assume salaries follow the average age profile --
   i.e. young people earn more as they age, at least for a while --
   as estimated from the data.
* Escenario 5: Reducción a 1150 semanas para mujeres en RPM
** Reasons it's an underestimate to the cost figure we seek.
*** It considers a drop only to 1150 weeks.
*** PITFALL: It considers the change for all women.
    She mentions that the change has been considered
    for women earning less than 2 minimum wages,
    but what she analyzes is what would happen
    if it applied to all of them.
