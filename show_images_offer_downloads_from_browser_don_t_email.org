#+title: show images, offer downloads from browser, don't email (in tax.co.web)
* why urgent
** because sending from my own email is dangerous
* Can I open a new tab with the image, without storing the image?
* Know if someone closes the page
  If so, stop the process and delete their folder.
* offer a link they can visit later
* Get someone's IP?
** So they can't make more than one request
   I need a way of ensuring one person doesn't flood the order queue.
