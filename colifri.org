*** "articulación de rutas basadas en la movilidad"
    I don't know what that means,
    but it's part of "Formación",
    another element of which is [[https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/knowledge_graph_with_github-navigable_links/blob/master/colifri.org#across-country-student-interchange][across-country student interchange]].
*** innovation
*** development
* it collects membership fees
* its organization
** "Colifri Colombia" and "Colifri France" are separate networks.
   I'm assuming of Colombian and French members, respectively.
** Colifri Colombia has three committees:
*** The comité de regionalización
**** its purpose
     appears to be to grow the network --
     absorbing members and finding projects
**** its makeup
     It consists of "nodes".
     So far there are four:
       Antioquia, Cali, Eje Cafetero, and Santander Bucaramanga
***** TODO Does that mean the rest of Colombia is not yet in it?
*** The comité científico
**** its apparent purposes
***** figure out how members from both countries can cooperate to a project
***** create a group of "asesores" to provide "lineamientos" for research
      I'm guessing this means appointing such a panel for each project.
*** The comité académico
**** its purposes
***** decide what to think about
***** figure out who's good at what
***** work on academic policy
* things they have done in Colombia
** A research project on how to use sustainable energy in developing areas.
   More than 60 researchers were involved.
