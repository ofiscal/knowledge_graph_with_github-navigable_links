#+title: fix how exemptions are applied to "most income"
* DONE where it's blocked
  I asked LCR who I should ask to check the work; he hasn't responded.
* DONE history
  LCR, Daniel, Angelica and I met in person about this on 2021 07 28.
  It then fell off our radar.
  I rediscovered this note and implemented the change on <2022-09-01 Thu>,
  in commit da580efdbda43169f30bb0bd0264fe0134017bf0.
* DONE the correction
min (
      ( ppl["income, labor"]
        - ppl["tax, ss, total employee contribs"]
        - "those exemptions" ),
   0 )
+ rental + interest + non-labor

To that whole thing, apply the marginal tax scchedule.
(The min(_,0) is the part not yet implemented.)
