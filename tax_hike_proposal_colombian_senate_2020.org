#+title: tax hike proposal, Colombian Senate, 2020
* the law
** new and changed taxes
*** part 1: wealth tax change
 I'm asking Daniel if it's measured in pesos (surely it is) or UVT.
 The brackets have changed but so too have the rates risen a lot,
 so we can put a minimum on the increase in revenue.
*** part 2: personal dividend income tax change
*** part 3: personal income tax change
 Section 3, the first table.
 (The second one in theory should have no effect.)
*** part 4: change in inheritance tax
** all other taxes remain unchanged
*** and the definitions of the income they cover are the same
* TODO modifying tax.co for the proposal
** PTIFALLS
*** everything is specified in UVTs
*** I have not included inheritance income in
**** non-labor income
**** private income
*** The proposal's changes are only to schedules, not definitions.
**** The definitions of income taxed are the same.
**** All other taxes continue to apply, except the old inheritance tax.
Previously inheritance was part of the set of "ingresos ocasionales"
taxed at 20%. Now it is progressive, and the old tax on it no longer applies.
** DONE inheritance income: incorporate into relevant totals
** DONE inheritance income: add taxes for it
ape the dividend tax
** DONE inheritance income: propogate to (not through) overview.py
** DONE replace python.regime.r2018.non_dividend_income_tax
** DONE replace the dividend portion of python.regime.r2018.income_taxes
** DONE include both pre- and post-proposal taxes
** TODO ? tests
** TODO present
*** Compute average of a given kind of tax per percentile.
*** Graph tax/income against income %ile for each kind of tax (2 curves/plot).
*** Total tax/income against income %ile, including VAT and SS.

* does DIAN say how much revenue they took in from each wealth bracket in the wealth tax?
Daniel's not sure this is it, but
"the best data set I found was Estad√≠sticas de recaudo mensual" (attached to the email).
