These are not specific to any one survey.
They define more terms than are described here.
** Unidad de Gasto = household, probably directorio
** Perceptor de ingresos = receiver of income
** Corriente = usual (income), excluding windfalls
** Transferencias y prestaciones corrientes
Transferencias = government transfers
Prestaciones = employee's income spent by the employer on services for the employee, such as healthcare or (probably) pensions.
** Ingreso total disponible de los hogares.
What the earner takes home -- the money remaining after those forced payments for things like SS.
** Ingreso regular = regular periodic income; excludes windfalls
How is that different from Corriente?
