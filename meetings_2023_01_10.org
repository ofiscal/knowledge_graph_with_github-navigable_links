#+title: meetings 2023-01-10
* meeting w/ Oliver, 10 AM
** two main projects
*** Daniel's public contract project
**** most public expenditures get reported in these systems
**** campaign contribs are also public
**** sometimes the same cedula uses different names
**** if you fund more than 2% of a campaign, you can't receive a contract from them
**** should keep records of changes
     Someone wanted to build a pier in Boyaca,
     then moved it at the last minute to San Andres.
**** I should code review Daniel.
** TODO talk to Daniel, William, find out more about the contract program
*** which web pages? how to navigate?
* meeting w/ Daniel, 2 PM
** look into embeddings
   do we need a finance-specific one?
** Daniel's plan
   serial
*** make data
**** scraping sources
**** OCR for tables from PDFs
**** Cleaning by Transparencia por Colombia
**** Experts
     our William Reyes
     academic papers
     journalists
*** make these in parallel
**** models based on labeled data
***** data
****** contracts
****** criminal histories (people & corporate)
       some from news, most from public databases
***** outputs will be used to preict fishiness and potential damage
****** potential damage = Pr( fishy ) * contract value
**** unsupervised learning
     Uses the same input as the labeled data system.
     Different kind of output from that system, though,
     to be used for clustering.
**** expert system
     rules-based system (no ML, no regression)
     built from advice from human experts
*** use them
**** each predicts some of : fishiness, potential damage
**** combine those predictions to create things to publish
** Mariana works at De Justicia which shares a building with Transparencia por Colombia
