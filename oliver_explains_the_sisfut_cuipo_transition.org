#+title: Oliver explains the SISFUT-CUIPO transition
  These are notes taken during an online meeting, <2023-07-26 Wed>.
* FUT is something the munis and depts have to fill.
* DNP compiles them into the SISFUT db.
* Parallel, they used to send other info to the Contralor√≠a.
* The FUT was not up to international standards.
* They decided to standardize those systems into one.
* That's the job of Dept Apoyo Fiscal -- they help munis and depts meet those reporting standards. It's part of Hacienda.
* Nestor Urea: head of Dept of Apoyo Fiscal, branch of Minhacienda
* FUT ended at/after 2021
  because it did not meet int'l standards,
  and because munis were sending different info to CGR, to min finance, and to DNP.
* So the new info is to meet int'l standards. That's CUIPO.
* Comparing inversion and funcionamiento works.
